        <p>I wrote all the code myself. The backend server is running on a Digital Ocean droplet.
        Pictures, video and metadata files are stored on DropBox. The server fetches them from DropBox
        and serves them as requested. DropBox also provides image compression, which is very nice of them
        because their giant servers can do it really fast.</p>
        <p>The source for my backend server is at
